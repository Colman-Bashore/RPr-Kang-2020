## Abstract

Kang, Michels, Lyu, Wang, Agbodo, Freeman and Wang ([2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x)) published a report outlining a quick and reproducible methodogy that measures and visualizes the access that two different populations, COVID-19 patients and the population risk (defined as those over 50), have to two important resources, ICU beds and Ventilators. To rapidly measure accessibility to Covid-19 healthcare, Kang et al. developed a methodology for [parallel implementation](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/parallel-computing#:~:text=Parallel%20computing%20refers%20to%20the,part%20of%20an%20overall%20algorithm.) of an Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2FSCA) methodology. This method calculates the ratio between a service (in this scenario, hospital ICU beds or ventilators) and the population in its surrounding area, accounting for distance decay. Because this is a computationally intensive analysis hat uses large street networks, the authors developed a parallel-E2FSCA (P-E2FSCA), which enables the use of up to 4 processors while implementing the analysis.


In this study, we will attempt to identically reproduce the 2020
