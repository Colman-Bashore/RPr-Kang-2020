# Replication Study of Kang et al 2020

This study is a replication of

Kang, J. Y., A. Michels, F. Lyu, Shaohua Wang, N. Agbodo, V. L. Freeman, and Shaowen Wang. 2020. Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA. *International Journal of Health Geographics* **19** (1):1â€“17. DOI:[10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x).

The original paper is an implementation of the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2FCA) method of spatial accessibility measurement in health geography, applied to accessibility of intensive care unit beds and ventilators in the state of Illinois for vulnerable people aged 50 or over or diagnosed with COVID-19. The study is significant in its use of parallel processing and cyberinfrastructure, implemented on the [CyberGISX](https://cybergisx.cigi.illinois.edu) system, and the study provides reproducibility and transparency for the COVID-19 spatial health services accessibility dashboard, [Where COVID-19](https://wherecovid19.cigi.illinois.edu/).
